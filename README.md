### A blue pin with the current location and a bus icon will appear along with a pop-up with the bus route, name, and distance information. The "Get direction" button links the user to the location of the bus stop with Google Maps. The "View bus time and live updates" button will connect the user to the official Aggie bus website for live bus updates and schedules for that route.
