                <p1><b>We understand the value of time in a typical college students life.</b><br><br> For students at Texas A&M University, with the campus being so large, and the weather being so hot, it can be unbearable at times to walk to different locations across campus. Our website provides an interactive map that calculates the nearest bus from your current location. You no longer need to manually check every bus route to determine which bus is closest to you. Let BAMaps do the work for you!</p1>
